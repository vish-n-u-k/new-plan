# Prompt: Visualize Frontend Screens as Block-Label Wireframe

Given the following fe_details.json file, generate a simple block-label wireframe diagram that visualizes the main screens/pages described. Each block should represent a distinct screen or view, labeled with its name. If possible, show navigation or parent/child relationships as arrows or lines between blocks. Ignore low-level UI components unless they represent entire screens. The goal is to provide a high-level map of the UI structure for this module.

Input: fe_details.json (see below)

Output: A block-label wireframe diagram (e.g., using Mermaid, ASCII, or any clear visual format) that shows all main screens/pages and their relationships.

Be concise, logical, and only include what is clearly described in the input. If relationships are ambiguous, note them as such.
